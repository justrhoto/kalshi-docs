# Order Entry

> Submit, modify, and cancel orders through FIX messages

## New Order Single (35=D)

Used to submit a new order to the Exchange.

| Tag | Name | Type | Required | Description |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 11 | ClOrdID | String | Y | Client order ID for idempotency. UUID preferred, max 64 chars. Must not match any open order. |
| 18 | ExecInst | Char | N | `6`=Post Only, `E`=Reduce Only (IOC only; not supported with QuoteId) |
| 38 | OrderQty | Decimal | Y | Quantity of contracts. Fractional quantities supported. |
| 40 | OrdType | Char | Y | `2`=Limit |
| 44 | Price | Decimal | Y | Limit price per contract. Whole cents (1–99) by default, or dollars with up to four decimal places when `UseDollars=Y`. See [Subpenny Pricing](/fix/subpenny-pricing). |
| 50 | SenderSubID | String | N | Clearing FCM sponsored access only. Header field identifying the operator for this order; printable ASCII, max 16 characters. |
| 54 | Side | Char | Y | `1`=Buy (Yes), `2`=Sell (No) |
| 55 | Symbol | String | Y | Market ticker (e.g. `EURUSD-23JUN2618-B1.087`) |
| 100 | ExDestination | Integer | N | Exchange index. On event-contract sessions, omit or use `-1` to auto-route by market ticker. This field should not be included for margin. It will be ignored. `UseCapReservation` (21032) sessions must auto-route. |
| 59 | TimeInForce | Char | N | `0`=Day (expires 11:59:59.999pm ET), `1`=GTC, `3`=IOC, `4`=FOK, `6`=GTD. Past GTD dates are treated as IOC. |
| 126 | ExpireTime | UTCTimestamp | C | Required when TimeInForce=GTD. |
| 117 | QuoteId | UUID | N | Quote to accept when using NewOrderSingle for an RFQ quote acceptance. Reduce-only (`18=E`) is not supported and is rejected. |
| 448 | PartyID | String | N | FCM only. Full customer-account identifier in `<fcm_user_id>_<suffix>` format. See [FCM customer-account identifiers](#fcm-customer-account-identifiers). |
| 452 | PartyRole | Integer | N | FCM only. `24`=Customer Account. Required when using PartyID. |
| 453 | NoPartyIDs | Integer | N | FCM only. Number of parties (only 1 supported). |
| 79 | AllocAccount | Integer | N | Subaccount number (0–63). Alternative to NoPartyIDs. |
| 526 | SecondaryClOrdID | UUID | N | [Order group](/fix/order-groups) identifier. |
| 2964 | SelfTradePreventionType | Integer | N | `1`=Taker At Cross (default), `2`=Maker |
| 21006 | CancelOrderOnPause | Boolean | N | Cancel order if trading is paused. |
| 21009 | MaxExecutionCost | Decimal | N | Max execution cost in dollars. Order canceled if unable to fill within cost. |
| 21023 | RfqId | UUID | N | Server-assigned RFQ ID when using NewOrderSingle to accept an RFQ quote. If provided, the quote must belong to this RFQ. |

### FCM customer-account identifiers

For FCM customer accounts (`PartyRole<452>=24`), send the full subtrader identifier in `PartyID<448>`: `<fcm_user_id>_<suffix>`. The prefix is the FCM's 36-character UUID, followed by an underscore (`_`) delimiter and a suffix of 1–16 case-sensitive ASCII alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`). The full identifier is at most 53 characters, including the delimiter.

For example: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000_customer1`.

Order Cancel and Order Cancel/Replace requests must use the same full identifier as the original order. Execution Reports return the full customer-account identifier unchanged in the `PartyRole=24` entry, including the UUID prefix, underscore, and suffix. A `PartyRole=12` entry instead contains the operator identifier captured from `SenderSubID<50>`.

<Note>
  `SenderSubID<50>` is captured on an ordinary NewOrderSingle and, per action, on OrderCancelRequest and OrderCancelReplaceRequest; it is ignored on RFQ quote acceptance. The operator on a NewOrderSingle sticks to the order: fills and other lifecycle reports emit it as the PartyRole=12 party. Cancel and Cancel/Replace acknowledgements instead emit the operator sent on that request — the operator who performed the action — falling back to the order's creating operator when the request carried none. Do not send tag 50 on Logon: Kalshi rejects that Logon.

## Order Cancel/Replace Request (35=G)

Used to modify an existing order without canceling it.

### Supported Modifications

* **OrderQty**: Increases or decreases the quantity of your order, note that increasing the quantity for the same point means forfeiting your queue position

* **Price**: Changes the limit price of your order

* **Expiry**: Use Day (`59=0`) without `126` to expire at 11:59:59.999pm ET, set a future deadline with `TimeInForce=GTD` (`59=6`) and `ExpireTime` (`126`), or remove expiry with `TimeInForce=GTC` (`59=1`) and no `126`. Expired deadlines, including the Unix epoch, are rejected.

**Kalshi conventions for replace:** Omitting both `59` and `126` preserves the
order's current expiry. This is a Kalshi-specific convention, rather than FIX's
Day default for omitted `59`. To resend expiry explicitly, send `59=6` with the
unchanged `126` for GTD, `59=0` without `126` for Day, or `59=1` without `126`
for GTC. Send the current total `OrderQty` and price for an expiry-only amendment. Kalshi guarantees that an
expiry-only amendment preserves FIFO queue position when price and quantity
are unchanged.

| 41 | OrigClOrdID | String | Y | ClOrdID of the order to modify. |
| 44 | Price | Decimal | N | New limit price. Required if changing price. Whole cents (1–99) by default, or dollars with up to four decimal places when `UseDollars=Y`. See [Subpenny Pricing](/fix/subpenny-pricing). |

## Execution Report (35=8)

Sent by the exchange to reflect order state changes.

Replaced reports confirm the resulting validity with `TimeInForce=GTD` (`59=6`)
and the accepted `ExpireTime` (`126`), or `TimeInForce=GTC` (`59=1`) without `126`
when there is no expiry. Kalshi stores Day orders as explicit deadlines, so their
Replaced reports also use GTD with the end-of-day ET deadline; they do not echo
the original Day value.

* **INTERNAL\_ERROR** - a reject from a healthy exchange that could not be mapped to a specific reason. The order was not applied, so it is safe to fix and resubmit. Maps to OrdRejReason "Other"
* **MARKET\_ALREADY\_CLOSED** - maps to OrdRejReason "Exchange closed"
* **MARKET\_INACTIVE** - maps to OrdRejReason "Exchange closed"
* **MARKET\_NOT\_FOUND** - maps to OrdRejReason "Unknown symbol"
* **SELF\_CROSS\_ATTEMPT** - maps to ExecutionType "Canceled"
* **SELF\_CROSS\_ATTEMPT\_PARTIALLY\_FILLED** - maps to ExecutionType "Canceled"

* **EXCEEDED\_SELL\_POSITION\_FLOOR** - maps to OrdRejReason "Order exceeds limit"
* **EVENT\_CONTRACT\_DAILY\_CAP\_EXCEEDED** - the customer account's remaining event contract daily cap cannot cover this order. `UseCapReservation` (21032) sessions only. Maps to OrdRejReason "Order exceeds limit"
* **EVENT\_CONTRACT\_DAILY\_CAP\_NOT\_FOUND** - the customer account has no daily cap configured, so the cap lane cannot accept orders for it. `UseCapReservation` (21032) sessions only. Maps to OrdRejReason "Unknown account"
* **ORDER\_AMEND\_IN\_PROGRESS** - a previous amend for this order has not settled yet. `UseCapReservation` (21032) sessions only. Maps to CxlRejReason "Broker"
* **ORDER\_ATTRIBUTES\_MISMATCH** - Symbol or Side does not match the resting order. `UseCapReservation` (21032) sessions only. Maps to CxlRejReason "Unknown order"
* **CUSTOMER\_ACCOUNT\_NOT\_FOUND** - maps to OrdRejReason "Unknown account"

* **REDUCE\_ONLY** - reduce-only order canceled because there was no position to reduce. Maps to ExecutionType "Canceled"
* **EXPIRED** - maps to OrdRejReason "Stale order" (RFQ quote had expired when the order arrived)

### OrderCancelReject (35=9)

Exchange-side amend and cancel failures are returned as OrderCancelReject (35=9), not ExecutionReport.

| Text (58) | CxlRejReason (102) |
| - | - |
| `INVALID_AMEND_QTY_FOR_ORDER` | Broker |
| `CANNOT_UPDATE_FILLED_ORDER` | Broker |
| `SELF_CROSS_ATTEMPT` | Invalid price increment |
| `ORDER_AMEND_IN_PROGRESS` | Broker |
| `ORDER_ATTRIBUTES_MISMATCH` | Unknown order |
| `EVENT_CONTRACT_DAILY_CAP_EXCEEDED` | Broker |

### Position and Fee Information

When ExecType=Trade:

| Tag | Name | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 704 | LongQty | Net Yes position after trade as a decimal quantity |
| 705 | ShortQty | Net No position after trade as a decimal quantity |
| 136 | NoMiscFees | Number of fees |
| 137 | MiscFeeAmt | Total fees in dollars |
| 138 | MiscFeeCurr | Currency (USD) |
| 139 | MiscFeeType | Exchange Fees\<4> |
| 891 | MiscFeeBasis | Fee unit (always ABSOLUTE\<0>) |
| 880 | TrdMatchID | Unique trade identifier |
| 1057 | AggressorIndicator | Taker/Maker flag |

### Collateral Changes

| Tag | Name | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 1703 | NoCollateralAmountChanges | Number of collateral changes |
| 1704 | CollateralAmountChange | Delta in dollars |
| 1705 | CollateralAmountType | BALANCE or PAYOUT |

### Collateral Return Breakdown

When Logon tag `21027` (`SplitCollateralReturn`) is set to `Y`, Execution Reports with `ExecType=Trade` include:

| Tag | Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| 21030 | SingleMarketCollateralReturn | Decimal | Collateral freed from reducing/closing a position in a single market. In dollars. Only present when non-zero. |
| 21031 | RangedMarketCollateralReturn | Decimal | Collateral freed from MECNET/DIRECNET netting across a market group. In dollars. Only present when non-zero. |

Both values are informational subsets of the `BALANCE` collateral change — they describe components within the total balance delta, not additional amounts.

### Party Information

ExecutionReports independently include the customer account when applicable and at most one operator entry (Executing Trader\<12>). Which operator appears depends on the report type: fills and other order-lifecycle reports (expiration, IOC cancellation, and similar) carry the operator captured at order creation, while Cancel and Cancel/Replace acknowledgements carry the operator sent on the acting request, falling back to the creation operator when that request carried none. When both a customer-account entry and an operator entry are present, the customer-account entry comes first.

| Tag | Name | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 453 | NoPartyIDs | Number of parties: one or two |
| 448 | PartyID | Customer-account or operator identifier |
| 452 | PartyRole | Customer Account\<24> or Executing Trader\<12> |
| 79 | AllocAccount | Subaccount number (0-63) |
