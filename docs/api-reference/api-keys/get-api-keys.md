        `read::portfolio_balance`, `write::trade`, `write::transfer`,
        `write::fcm_risk` (FCM subtrader creation, trading blocks, daily premium
        caps, and margin caps), and `write::block_trade_accept` grant only their
        specific endpoint group and can be granted without the parent scope.
