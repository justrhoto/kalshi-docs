# Create API Key

>  Endpoint for creating a new API key with a user-provided public key.  This endpoint allows users with Premier or Market Maker API usage levels to create API keys by providing their own RSA or Ed25519 public key in PEM format. The platform will use this public key to verify signatures on API requests: RSA-PSS with SHA-256 for RSA keys, Ed25519 for Ed25519 keys.

            subtrader without a daily cap has its event-contract orders rejected
            until one is set, while a margin subtrader without an initial-margin
            cap is bounded only by firm-level risk limits.

        caps, and margin caps), and `write::block_trade_accept` grant only their
        specific endpoint group and can be granted without the parent scope.
