# Get Historical Cutoff Timestamps

> Returns the archive's cutoff timestamps. For positions, the cutoff is the backfill horizon; visibility in the historical API waits for a buffered, whole-event handoff.

## Cutoff fields
- `market_settled_ts` : Markets that **settled** before this timestamp, and their candlesticks, must be accessed via `GET /historical/markets` and `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`.
- `trades_created_ts` : Trades that were **filled** before this timestamp must be accessed via `GET /historical/fills`.
- `orders_updated_ts` : Orders that were **canceled or fully executed** before this timestamp must be accessed via `GET /historical/orders`. Resting (active) orders are always available in `GET /portfolio/orders`.
- `market_positions_last_updated_ts` : Backfill horizon for settled positions, not a guaranteed archive-visibility boundary. An event moves to `GET /historical/positions` only after its buffered handoff completes. Until then, its settled positions remain available via `GET /portfolio/positions?settlement_status=settled`. Unsettled positions remain available in `GET /portfolio/positions`.

      summary: Get Historical Cutoff Timestamps
      description: >
        Returns the archive's cutoff timestamps. For positions, the cutoff is
        the backfill horizon; visibility in the historical API waits for a
        buffered, whole-event handoff.


        ## Cutoff fields

        - `market_settled_ts` : Markets that **settled** before this timestamp,
        and their candlesticks, must be accessed via `GET /historical/markets`
        and `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`.

        - `trades_created_ts` : Trades that were **filled** before this

        Resting (active) orders are always available in `GET /portfolio/orders`.

        - `market_positions_last_updated_ts` : Backfill horizon for settled
        positions, not a guaranteed archive-visibility boundary. An event moves
        to `GET /historical/positions` only after its buffered handoff
        completes. Until then, its settled positions remain available via `GET
        /portfolio/positions?settlement_status=settled`. Unsettled positions
        remain available in `GET /portfolio/positions`.
