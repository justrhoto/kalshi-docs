# Get Positions

> Returns unsettled positions by default. Set `settlement_status=settled` to page through settled positions that are still in the live data set, or `settlement_status=all` for both live states. Positions already archived are available via `GET /historical/positions`.
Settled and all-state positions are paginated by event ticker to keep large histories bounded. Cursors are specific to the selected settlement status.
`count_filter` restricts positions to those with a non-zero position or total traded count.
Registered partners may also use a user OAuth access token with the explicitly granted read::compliance_partner scope.
