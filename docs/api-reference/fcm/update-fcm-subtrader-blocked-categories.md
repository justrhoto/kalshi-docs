# Update FCM Subtrader Blocked Categories

> Adds one event category to, or removes one from, the set an FCM member
has blocked for one of its subtraders. The subtrader must belong to the
requesting FCM. Blocks apply prospectively: new orders the subtrader
places through its bound API credentials are rejected in markets whose
event belongs to a blocked category, while orders already resting are
not cancelled. Returns the subtrader's full resulting blocked set.
