# Create FCM Position Transfer

> Endpoint for FCM members to move a position in one market from one of their subtraders into a
subtrader under their FCM's error account.

**This endpoint must be enabled for your FCM by Kalshi.** Kalshi enables it by configuring the
error account that receives transferred positions and gives you that account's user id, which
prefixes `target_subtrader_id`. Contact Kalshi to enable it; until then, requests return 400.

- The destination is always your FCM's error account. `target_subtrader_id` picks the subtrader
  under it, which is created on first use.
- Each request moves one market for one source subtrader. To move many positions, send one
  request per subtrader and market.
- The transfer is booked like a trade at `price_centicents`, which is always the YES price, even
  when moving NO. No fee is charged and no fill is created. For YES, the error account pays the
  price per contract; for NO, it pays $1 minus the price per contract. The FCM receives the same
  amount. Use 0 for YES or 10000 for NO to move no cash. These amounts assume the source holds
  the side being moved and the target subtrader holds no opposite position in that market;
  otherwise the positions net like a trade and the balance changes differ.
- The source's current position is not checked. A request for more than the source holds, or
  with the opposite sign, flips or grows the source's position.
- Requests are not idempotent. After a timeout or 5xx, check the position before retrying.
- The market must be open, neither account may be blocked, and the error account must have
  enough available balance on the market's exchange index to pay for the transfer. Otherwise
  the request returns 409.

**Example: moving YES.** A customer subtrader holds 10 YES contracts. Send
`position_centicount` 1000 and `price_centicents` 4500 (YES at 45 cents):
- The customer subtrader goes from 10 YES to 0, and the error account subtrader from 0 to 10 YES.
- The error account pays 10 x $0.45 = $4.50 and the FCM receives $4.50.
- Sending `price_centicents` 0 instead moves the position with no cash.

**Example: moving NO.** A customer subtrader holds 5 NO contracts. Send `position_centicount`
-500 and `price_centicents` 7000 (YES at 70 cents, so NO at 30 cents):
- The customer subtrader goes from 5 NO to 0, and the error account subtrader from 0 to 5 NO.
- The error account pays 5 x $0.30 = $1.50 and the FCM receives $1.50.
- Sending `price_centicents` 10000 instead moves the position with no cash. Sending 0 makes the
  error account pay the full $1 per contract ($5.00).

          the request returns 409.

        **Example: moving YES.** A customer subtrader holds 10 YES contracts.
        Send

        `position_centicount` 1000 and `price_centicents` 4500 (YES at 45
        cents):

        - The customer subtrader goes from 10 YES to 0, and the error account
        subtrader from 0 to 10 YES.

        - The error account pays 10 x $0.45 = $4.50 and the FCM receives $4.50.

        - Sending `price_centicents` 0 instead moves the position with no cash.


        **Example: moving NO.** A customer subtrader holds 5 NO contracts. Send
        `position_centicount`

        -500 and `price_centicents` 7000 (YES at 70 cents, so NO at 30 cents):

        - The customer subtrader goes from 5 NO to 0, and the error account
        subtrader from 0 to 5 NO.

        - The error account pays 5 x $0.30 = $1.50 and the FCM receives $1.50.

        - Sending `price_centicents` 10000 instead moves the position with no
        cash. Sending 0 makes the
          error account pay the full $1 per contract ($5.00).
