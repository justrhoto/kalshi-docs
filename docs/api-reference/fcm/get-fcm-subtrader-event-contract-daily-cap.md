# Get FCM Subtrader Event Contract Daily Cap

> Returns the event-contract daily premium cap configured for an FCM member's subtrader,
together with its live utilization. Executed utilization is the net premium deployed by
fills today (sells and settlements credit back); resting and pending utilization reserve
open and in-flight orders at their full worst-case cost plus fees. Executed utilization
resets at midnight New York time on the returned cap date; resting and pending
reservations persist for as long as their orders remain open, including across the reset.
Returns 404 when the subtrader has no cap configured — in that state every order placed
through the subtrader's bound API keys is rejected.
API keys bound to a single FCM subtrader may also call this endpoint: `subtrader_id` may be
omitted and defaults to the key's bound subtrader, and if supplied it must equal the bound
subtrader or the request is rejected.
