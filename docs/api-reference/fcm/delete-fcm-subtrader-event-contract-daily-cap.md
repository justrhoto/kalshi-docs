# Delete FCM Subtrader Event Contract Daily Cap

> Removes the event-contract daily premium cap for an FCM member's subtrader. Removal
closes the subtrader to new orders on cap-reservation sessions — every subtrader-bound
API key — until a cap is set again. It does not stop orders your own unbound sessions
submit on the subtrader's behalf; to stop the account entirely, block subtrader trading.
