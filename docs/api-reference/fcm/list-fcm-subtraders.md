# List FCM Subtraders

> Lists the authenticated FCM's event-contract subtraders, including accounts with
no trades. Exchange metadata is asynchronous, so newly created accounts may not
appear immediately. Trading block status includes firm-wide and Kalshi restrictions;
fcm_trading_blocked identifies the FCM's own per-subtrader restriction.
