# Create FCM Subtrader

> Endpoint for FCM members to create a subtrader on the event-contract exchange. The
subtrader is registered on every exchange shard that knows the FCM; a shard provisioned
later registers it lazily on the subtrader's first order there. Re-creating an existing
subtrader returns 409.
