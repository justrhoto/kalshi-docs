# Subaccounts

> Isolate balances and positions within a single Direct account

Subaccounts let a **Direct** account partition its balance and positions into
independent buckets under one set of API credentials. Every account has a
primary subaccount (number `0`) and may use numbered subaccounts `1`–`63`.

<Note>
  Subaccounts are currently an **API-only** feature — they are not yet supported in the
  Kalshi web or mobile app. Numbered-subaccount balances and positions are managed through
  the trade API.
</Note>

## Numbering

| Number | Meaning |
| - | - |
| `0` | Primary subaccount (the default account) |
| `1`–`63` | User-managed numbered subaccounts |

## Transfers

You can move cash between your own subaccounts with
`POST /portfolio/subaccounts/transfer` (amounts in cents). Transfers net to
zero at the account level — nothing leaves your account.

Transfers are idempotent on a client-supplied `client_transfer_id`: retrying
with the same value returns `409` instead of applying the transfer twice.

## Listing transfers

`GET /portfolio/subaccounts/transfers` returns your subaccount transfers,
paginated.

## Restricted API keys

When generating an API key you can restrict it to a single subaccount. A
restricted key can only read and trade on that subaccount: order placement and
management, portfolio reads (balance, positions, fills, settlements), order
groups, and the full REST RFQ lifecycle — creating combo markets in
multivariate event collections, creating and cancelling RFQs, posting,
confirming, and cancelling quotes, and accepting quotes. Requests that omit
`subaccount` act on the key's locked subaccount, and naming any other
subaccount is rejected.

On perps, a restricted key can place, amend, decrease, and cancel orders
(including cancel-all), manage order groups, and manage cross-margin exit
triggers on its locked subaccount. It can also list that subaccount's orders
(`GET /margin/orders`; naming any other subaccount is rejected), read them
individually (`GET /margin/orders/{order_id}` returns 404 for orders in any
other subaccount), and read that subaccount's positions and fills
(`GET /margin/positions` and `GET /margin/fills`, on the same terms as the
order list). Other authenticated perps endpoints, including balance
(`GET /margin/balance`), risk (`GET /margin/risk`), and funding history, are
not yet available to restricted keys.

Self-trade prevention applies across all subaccounts of an account. When an
order from a restricted key would trade against an order resting in another
subaccount, its `self_trade_prevention_type` decides the outcome:
`taker_at_cross` cancels the restricted key's order, and `maker` cancels the
resting order in the other subaccount.

A restricted key cannot transfer funds, manage subaccounts or API keys, or
act on RFQs and quotes belonging to a different subaccount of the same
account. Subaccount-scoped requests match rows created through the API with
an explicit subaccount identity; RFQs created in the web app are not
addressable per subaccount. Endpoints outside its allowed set return
`403 this API key is restricted to a single sub-account and cannot access
this endpoint`. On FIX, restricted keys support order entry and the maker
quote lifecycle only — RFQ creation (35=R) and quote acceptance (35=UA) are
not available to restricted FIX sessions.
