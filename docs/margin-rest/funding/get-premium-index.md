# Get Premium Index

> Returns an informational per-second premium index for a market, for a window of up to one hour. Each point is the signed fraction by which the impact-price book sat above or below the underlying index at that second, before any time weighting.

**These values are for informational purposes only and may not exactly match the premium-index values used in actual funding calculations.**

A second with no measurable premium reports `0` — the book was halted, the underlying was closed, or an input was unavailable. Points are only those recorded, so the response may be sparse or empty for a range that predates the retention period or was never recorded.
