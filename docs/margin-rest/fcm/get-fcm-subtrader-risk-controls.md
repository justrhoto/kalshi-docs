# Get FCM Subtrader Risk Controls

> Returns the risk controls configured for an FCM member's subtrader on the margined
exchange: the FCM-set initial margin caps in `risk_controls`, and the admin-set notional
value risk limits in `notional_limits` — one call returns the subtrader's complete limit
picture. A cap with neither market_ticker nor asset_class applies across all markets; the
remaining caps are scoped to a single market or a single asset class each. A
notional_limits entry without a market_ticker is the whole-subtrader (all-markets) limit;
the rest are per-market. Every cap or limit in scope for an order is enforced
independently. Markets without a cap are omitted.
API keys bound to a single FCM subtrader may also call this endpoint: `subtrader_id` may be
omitted and defaults to the key's bound subtrader, and if supplied it must equal the bound
subtrader or the request is rejected.

      summary: Get FCM Subtrader Risk Controls
      description: >
        Returns the risk controls configured for an FCM member's subtrader on
        the margined

        exchange: the FCM-set initial margin caps in `risk_controls`, and the
        admin-set notional

        value risk limits in `notional_limits` — one call returns the
        subtrader's complete limit

        picture. A cap with neither market_ticker nor asset_class applies across
        all markets; the

        remaining caps are scoped to a single market or a single asset class
        each. A

        notional_limits entry without a market_ticker is the whole-subtrader
        (all-markets) limit;

        the rest are per-market. Every cap or limit in scope for an order is
        enforced

        independently. Markets without a cap are omitted.

        API keys bound to a single FCM subtrader may also call this endpoint:
        `subtrader_id` may be

        omitted and defaults to the key's bound subtrader, and if supplied it
        must equal the bound

        subtrader or the request is rejected.

            model (positions plus resting orders), so it excludes orders still
            in flight and may slightly trail the engine. A market-scoped cap
            prices that market standalone; an asset-class cap prices the
            class-filtered portfolio, so hedged positions within the class
            margin jointly rather than summing per-market.

          description: >-
            The notional currently consumed against this limit, in fixed-point
            US dollars. Per market it is the larger of the subtrader's long side
            (position plus resting bids) and short side (position minus resting
            asks), over the signed net position; a whole-subtrader entry carries
            that value summed across every market the subtrader touches. Every
            term is priced through the market's risk-notional model, the same
            pricing the exchange's limit check uses: the cached mark for
            positions and the limit price for resting orders on mark-model asset
            classes, quantity times the fixed DV01 base on Rates. Computed from
            the exchange's read model, so it excludes orders still in flight and
            may slightly trail the engine.
