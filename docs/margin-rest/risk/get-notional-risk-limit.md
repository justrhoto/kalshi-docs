# Get Notional Risk Limit

> Endpoint for retrieving the notional value risk limits for the authenticated margin user.
Direct members and FCM members may read their own account's limits. For an FCM member the
account-level limit covers the whole omnibus account: exposure across all client accounts
is aggregated against it.

            Map of market_ticker to notional value risk limit as a fixed-point
            dollar string with 4 decimal places (e.g., "5000.0000"). If present,
            the market-level risk limit overrides the default notional value
            risk limit.
          example:
            market-abc-123: '5000.0000'
        total_current_usage:
          allOf:
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/FixedPointDollars'
          description: >-
            The account's current notional usage in fixed-point US dollars,
            aggregated the way the exchange checks the account-level limit: per
            market, the larger of the long side (long positions plus resting
            bids) and the short side (short positions plus resting asks), summed
            across every market the account holds positions or resting orders in
            — for an FCM, across the whole omnibus account. Every term is priced
            through the market's risk-notional model, the same pricing the
            exchange's limit check uses: the cached mark for positions and the
            limit price for resting orders. Computed from the exchange's read
            model, so it excludes orders still in flight and may slightly trail
            the engine.
          example: '1250.0000'
        current_usage_by_market_ticker:
          type: object
          additionalProperties:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/FixedPointDollars'
          description: >-
            Per-market components of total_current_usage, as fixed-point US
            dollar strings. Entries exist only for markets where the account
            holds positions or resting orders; like the total, values come from
            the exchange's read model and may slightly trail the engine.
          example:
            market-abc-123: '1250.0000'
        member_notional_value_risk_limit:
          allOf:
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/FixedPointDollars'
          description: >-
            The account-level notional value risk limit the member set on its
            own account (FCM members only), as a fixed-point dollar string.
            Stored separately from the Kalshi-set limit; the exchange enforces
            the smaller of the two. Absent when the member has not set one.
          example: '5000.0000'
        effective_account_notional_value_risk_limit:
          allOf:
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/FixedPointDollars'
          description: >-
            The account-level notional value risk limit the exchange enforces,
            as a fixed-point dollar string - the smaller of the Kalshi-set limit
            and the member-set limit, or whichever one is set. Absent when
            neither is set.
          example: '5000.0000'
    FixedPointDollars:
      type: string
      description: >-
        Fixed-point US dollar string. Most request fields accept 2-4 decimal
        places (e.g., "0.56", "0.5600"); responses emit up to 6. Valid quote
        intervals for a given market are constrained by that market's price
        level structure.
      example: '0.5600'
