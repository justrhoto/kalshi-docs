# Communications

> Real-time Request for Quote (RFQ) and quote notifications. Requires authentication.

**Requirements:**
- Authentication required
- Market specification ignored
- Optional sharding for fanout control:
  - `shard_factor` (1-100) and `shard_key` (`0 <= key < shard_factor`)
- RFQ events (RFQCreated, RFQDeleted) are sent for all users by default. Set `user_filter: "self"` to receive only RFQs you created. Omitted or empty `user_filter` keeps the default.
- Quote events (QuoteCreated, QuoteAccepted, QuoteExecuted) are only sent if you created the quote OR you created the RFQ

**Use case:** Tracking RFQs you create and quotes on your RFQs, or quotes you create on others' RFQs. Use QuoteExecuted to correlate fill messages with quotes via client_order_id.
