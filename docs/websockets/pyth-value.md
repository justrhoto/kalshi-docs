# Pyth Value Feed

> Real-time Pyth price updates for configured underlying tickers. Requires authentication.

## Access and pricing

The Pyth data feed costs **$1,000/month**, with the **first seven days free**. [Subscribe to the Pyth data feed](https://buy.stripe.com/eVqaEXfmu9eN2ZB8gr4ZG0a).

Connect using an authenticated Kalshi WebSocket session. See [Quick Start: WebSockets](/getting_started/quick_start_websockets#authentication) for API key authentication and request signing.

## Commodities and underlying tickers

The reference table below includes spot metals, commodity futures, and indices. The gold and silver examples are only a subset of the feed coverage.

| Pyth feed ID | Pyth symbol | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 345 | `Metal.XAG/USD` | Silver price in USD |
| 346 | `Metal.XAU/USD` | Gold price in USD |
| 2937 | `Commodities.CCU6/USD` | Cocoa futures (Sept 2026) in USD |
| 3052 | `Commodities.COU6/USD` | Crude Oil futures (Sept 2026) in USD |
| 3053 | `Commodities.COZ6/USD` | Crude Oil futures (Dec 2026) in USD |
| 3080 | `Commodities.WHU6/USD` | Wheat futures (Sept 2026) in USD |
| 3081 | `Commodities.WHZ6/USD` | Wheat futures (Dec 2026) in USD |
| 3085 | `Commodities.SOU6/USD` | Soybeans futures (Sept 2026) in USD |
| 3086 | `Commodities.SOX6/USD` | Soybeans futures (Nov 2026) in USD |
| 3063 | `Commodities.Index.PYTHOIL/USD` | Blended Oil Index in USD |
| 3153 | `Metal.Index.GOLD/USD` | Blended Gold Index in USD |
| 3712 | `Metal.Index.1OZGOLD/USD` | 1-Ounce Gold Index in USD |
| 3154 | `Metal.Index.SILVER/USD` | Blended Silver Index in USD |
| 3045 | `Commodities.BRENTX6/USD` | Brent Crude futures (Nov 2026) in USD |
| 3525 | `Commodities.Index.CU/USD` | Copper Index in USD |
| 3265 | `Commodities.Index.NATGAS/USD` | Natural Gas Index in USD |
| 3446 | `Commodities.Index.BRENT/USD` | Blended Brent Crude Index in USD |
| 1781 | `Metal.XPT/USD` | Platinum price in USD |
| 1780 | `Metal.XPD/USD` | Palladium price in USD |

Pass the exact **Pyth symbol** in `underlying_tickers`. The numeric Pyth feed IDs are reference information and are not subscription parameters for this channel. Kalshi market tickers are not Pyth underlying tickers.

Use `underlying_list` to discover recently streamed tickers on your connection. Availability can change, including as futures contracts expire; the table does not guarantee that every feed is streaming in every environment.

## Requirements

- Authentication required
- Seed `underlying_tickers` in the initial subscribe, or add them later
- Use `underlying_tickers: ["all"]` to receive every available underlying
- Supports `update_subscription` with `subscribe_underlyings`, `unsubscribe_underlyings`, and `underlying_list` actions
- Duplicate and out-of-order source timestamps are ignored independently per underlying ticker

## Subscription workflow

Subscribe to `pyth_value` with the underlying tickers you want to receive. For example, request gold, oil, and natural gas prices:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "cmd": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "channels": ["pyth_value"],
    "underlying_tickers": [
      "Metal.XAU/USD",
      "Commodities.Index.PYTHOIL/USD",
      "Commodities.Index.NATGAS/USD"
    ]
  }
}
```

A successful subscribe returns a `subscribed` response with the assigned `sid`. Use that subscription ID in subsequent commands; replace `sid: 1` in the examples below with the returned ID.

You can also omit `underlying_tickers` to create an empty subscription, discover tickers, and add them later. An empty subscription sends no price updates until you add tickers or switch to `["all"]`.

### Discover recently streamed tickers

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "cmd": "update_subscription",
  "params": {
    "sid": 1,
    "action": "underlying_list"
  }
}
```

Read `msg.underlying_tickers` in the `pyth_value_underlying_list` response. This lists tickers observed on the stream within the last two hours without changing your subscription. It is not a complete catalog: inactive feeds can be absent. A successful subscribe response alone does not confirm that a requested ticker is streaming.

### Add or remove tickers

Add platinum to the existing subscription:

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "cmd": "update_subscription",
  "params": {
    "sid": 1,
    "action": "subscribe_underlyings",
    "underlying_tickers": ["Metal.XPT/USD"]
  }
}
```

Remove platinum from the subscription:

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "cmd": "update_subscription",
  "params": {
    "sid": 1,
    "action": "unsubscribe_underlyings",
    "underlying_tickers": ["Metal.XPT/USD"]
  }
}
```

### Receive all available underlyings

Set `underlying_tickers` to `["all"]` in the initial subscribe, or enable it on an existing subscription:

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "cmd": "update_subscription",
  "params": {
    "sid": 1,
    "action": "subscribe_underlyings",
    "underlying_tickers": ["all"]
  }
}
```

While all-mode is enabled, removing an individual ticker does not exclude it. Send `unsubscribe_underlyings` with `["all"]` to disable all-mode; any explicitly subscribed tickers remain selected.

## Integration notes

- `sid` identifies the subscription stream; use it for `update_subscription` and `unsubscribe`.
- Missing or empty `underlying_tickers` for `subscribe_underlyings` or `unsubscribe_underlyings` returns an `error` with `code: 28` ("Underlying tickers required").
- `value_usd` is a USD price string formatted to eight decimal places.
- `source_ts_ms` is the source timestamp in Unix milliseconds; `received_at` is when Kalshi received the update, also in Unix milliseconds.
