# Multivariate Market & Event Lifecycle

> Multivariate event (MVE) market state changes and event creation notifications.

**Requirements:**
- No additional channel-level authentication beyond the authenticated WebSocket connection
- Receives all multivariate market lifecycle notifications (`market_ticker` filters are not supported)
- Only emits lifecycle updates for multivariate events
- Event creation notifications

**Use case:** Tracking multivariate market lifecycle including creation, de(activation), close date changes, determination, settlement
