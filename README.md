# Kalshi Markdown Docs

[![Nightly Update](https://github.com/ammario/kalshi-docs/actions/workflows/update-docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ammario/kalshi-docs/actions/workflows/update-docs.yml)
[![License: CC0-1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC0_1.0-lightgrey.svg)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

An automated repository that downloads and archives all Kalshi documentation from their sitemap as markdown.

Updated nightly via GitHub Actions. A file is only rewritten when its content changes upstream, and pages Kalshi removes are deleted, so each commit's diff shows exactly what changed in the docs. To sync locally, run `bun run update.ts`.
