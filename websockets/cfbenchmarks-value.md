# CF Benchmarks Value Feed

> Real-time CF Benchmarks index value updates, each carrying the raw upstream frame plus trailing 60-second and quarter-hour final-minute averages. Requires authentication.

## Coins and index IDs

Use the following CF Benchmarks index IDs to request coin data on this channel or through the [REST passthrough](/cfbenchmarks/rest-passthrough). The BTC and ETH examples on this page are illustrative; they are not the full list of coins.

| Coin | CF Benchmarks index ID |
|------|------------------------|
| AAVE | `AAVEUSD_RTI` |
| ADA | `ADAUSD_RTI` |
| BCH | `BCHUSD_RTI` |
| BNB | `BNBUSD_RTI` |
| BTC | `BRTI` |
| DOGE | `DOGEUSD_RTI` |
| DOT | `DOTUSD_RTI` |
| ETH | `ETHUSD_RTI` |
| HBAR | `HBARUSD_RTI` |
| HYPE | `HYPEUSD_RTI` |
| LINK | `LINKUSD_RTI` |
| LTC | `LTCUSD_RTI` |
| NEAR | `NEARUSD_RTI` |
| SHIB / kSHIB | `SHIBUSD_RTI` |
| SOL | `SOLUSD_RTI` |
| SUI | `SUIUSD_RTI` |
| VVV | `VVVUSD_RTI` |
| WLD | `WLDUSD_RTI` |
| XLM | `XLMUSD_RTI` |
| XRP | `XRPUSD_RTI` |
| ZEC | `ZECUSD_RTI` |

Pass the index ID exactly as shown, rather than a coin symbol or Kalshi market ticker. For kSHIB, request `SHIBUSD_RTI`: values are USD per SHIB and are not scaled to kSHIB or a perpetual contract size.

Use the `indexlist` action below to check the index IDs available on your WebSocket connection. Availability can change; this table is a coin-to-index reference, not a guarantee that every index is streaming in every environment.

The [5Hz feed](/websockets/cfbenchmarks-value-5hz) has a smaller coin set: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and DOGE. Use `cfbenchmarks_value` for the other coins above.

## Requirements

- Authentication required
- Index specification via `index_ids` (array of CF Benchmarks index IDs, for example `["BRTI", "ETHUSD_RTI"]`)
- `market_ticker`/`market_tickers`/`market_id`/`market_ids` are not supported for this channel
- You can seed `index_ids` in the initial subscribe, or subscribe first and add indices later
- Use `index_ids: ["all"]` to receive every available index
- Supports `update_subscription` with `subscribe_indices` / `unsubscribe_indices` / `indexlist` actions
- `indexlist` returns the available index IDs (as a `cfbenchmarks_value_indexlist` message) without modifying the subscription
- Ticks are emitted roughly once per second; duplicate or out-of-order upstream source timestamps are ignored. For up to 5 updates per second on supported indices, see the [CF Benchmarks 5Hz Value Feed](/websockets/cfbenchmarks-value-5hz) sibling channel

**Use case:** Consuming CF Benchmarks reference index values and their short-window averages

## Subscription workflow

1. Subscribe to `cfbenchmarks_value` (optionally seeding `index_ids`). A successful subscribe returns a `subscribed` response with the assigned `sid`.
2. Discover available index IDs with the `indexlist` action; the server replies with a `cfbenchmarks_value_indexlist` message.
3. Add or remove tracked index IDs with `subscribe_indices` / `unsubscribe_indices`, or use `index_ids: ["all"]` to track everything.

For example, subscribe to BNB, HYPE, and SHIB values:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "cmd": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "channels": ["cfbenchmarks_value"],
    "index_ids": ["BNBUSD_RTI", "HYPEUSD_RTI", "SHIBUSD_RTI"]
  }
}
```

To discover the available indices, send the following after the `subscribed` response. Replace `sid: 1` with the subscription ID returned by the server:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "cmd": "update_subscription",
  "params": {
    "sid": 1,
    "action": "indexlist"
  }
}
```

Read the available IDs from `msg.index_ids` in the `cfbenchmarks_value_indexlist` response. This lists the channel's available indices without changing which ones you subscribe to. A successful `subscribe` response alone does not confirm that a requested index is available.

## Averaging semantics

`avg_60s_data` (always present):
- Window is trailing and per tick: `[source_ts_ms - 60000, source_ts_ms)`
- `window_size` counts prior ticks only
- If there are no prior ticks in the trailing window, the average falls back to the current tick value

`last_60s_windowed_average_15min` (present only in the final minute before quarter-hour close: `:00`, `:15`, `:30`, `:45`):
- Active accumulation window is `(quarter_close_ts_ms - 60000, quarter_close_ts_ms]`
- The start-boundary tick is excluded and the close tick is included
- This produces second-indexed counts: `:01 -> 1`, `:14 -> 14`, `:59 -> 59`, close tick (`:00/:15/:30/:45`) -> `60`
- The field is omitted outside that final-minute window

## Integration notes

- If you subscribe without any `index_ids`, no value events flow until you add indices or switch to `["all"]`
- `sid` identifies the subscription stream; use it for `update_subscription` and `unsubscribe`
- Missing `index_ids` for `subscribe_indices`/`unsubscribe_indices` returns an `error` with `code: 24` ("Index IDs required"); unsupported actions return a standard websocket `error`
- This channel is real-time only. Historical index values — including intra-second granularity on some indices — are available over REST via the [CF Benchmarks REST Passthrough](/cfbenchmarks/rest-passthrough); live intra-second updates are available on the [`cfbenchmarks_value_5hz`](/websockets/cfbenchmarks-value-5hz) channel
