# CF Benchmarks 5Hz Value Feed

> Real-time CF Benchmarks index value updates at up to 5 updates per second, each carrying the raw upstream frame plus parsed value fields. Requires authentication.

This is the high-frequency sibling of the once-per-second [`cfbenchmarks_value`](/websockets/cfbenchmarks-value) channel. It carries BTC (`BRTI`), ETH (`ETHUSD_RTI`), SOL (`SOLUSD_RTI`), XRP (`XRPUSD_RTI`), and DOGE (`DOGEUSD_RTI`) at up to five updates per second. For BNB, HYPE, NEAR, ZEC, SUI, BCH, LTC, LINK, SHIB/kSHIB, ADA, WLD, AAVE, VVV, and other per-second indices, see the [coin and index ID table](/websockets/cfbenchmarks-value#coins-and-index-ids). Use this channel's `indexlist` action to discover its available IDs. Messages are lean raw ticks — they do not include the 60-second or quarter-hour averages, which stay on the per-second channel.

**Requirements:**
- Authentication required
- Index specification via `index_ids` (array of CF Benchmarks index IDs, for example `["BRTI", "ETHUSD_RTI"]`)
- `market_ticker`/`market_tickers`/`market_id`/`market_ids` are not supported for this channel
- You can seed `index_ids` in the initial subscribe, or subscribe first and add indices later
- Use `index_ids: ["all"]` to receive every index available on this channel
- Supports `update_subscription` with `subscribe_indices` / `unsubscribe_indices` / `indexlist` actions
- `indexlist` returns the index IDs recently observed on this channel's stream (as a `cfbenchmarks_value_5hz_indexlist` message) without modifying the subscription
- Up to 5 ticks per second per index; duplicate or out-of-order upstream source timestamps are ignored

**Use case:** Consuming CF Benchmarks reference index values at the vendor's full publication rate

**Subscription workflow:**
1. Subscribe to `cfbenchmarks_value_5hz` (optionally seeding `index_ids`). A successful subscribe returns a `subscribed` response with the assigned `sid`.
2. Discover the streaming index IDs with the `indexlist` action; the server replies with a `cfbenchmarks_value_5hz_indexlist` message.
3. Add or remove tracked index IDs with `subscribe_indices` / `unsubscribe_indices`, or use `index_ids: ["all"]` to track everything on this channel.

**Integration notes:**
- If you subscribe without any `index_ids`, no value events flow until you add indices or switch to `["all"]`
- `sid` identifies the subscription stream; use it for `update_subscription` and `unsubscribe`
- Missing `index_ids` for `subscribe_indices`/`unsubscribe_indices` returns an `error` with `code: 24` ("Index IDs required"); unsupported actions return a standard websocket `error`
- Historical index values — including intra-second granularity — are available over REST via the [CF Benchmarks REST Passthrough](/cfbenchmarks/rest-passthrough)
