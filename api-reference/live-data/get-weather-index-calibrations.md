# Get Weather Index Calibrations

> Get a city's published weather-index configuration timeline: the launch configuration plus every weekly offset calibration and methodology update, ascending by effective time. Each record carries the station weights, station offsets (Celsius), and the city reference used to compute index values from the record's effective time until the next record — everything needed to reproduce published index values for minutes computed under that configuration version. Offsets are re-estimated weekly after each complete UTC week; weights never change through calibration. The timeline is append-only and complete: it is never trimmed.

      description: >-
        Get a city's published weather-index configuration timeline: the launch
        configuration plus every weekly offset calibration and methodology
        update, ascending by effective time. Each record carries the station
        weights, station offsets (Celsius), and the city reference used to
        compute index values from the record's effective time until the next
        record — everything needed to reproduce published index values for
        minutes computed under that configuration version. Offsets are
        re-estimated weekly after each complete UTC week; weights never change
        through calibration. The timeline is append-only and complete: it is
        never trimmed.
