# Update FCM Notional Risk Limit

> Sets the calling FCM member's own account-level notional value risk limit on the margined
exchange. The limit is stored separately from the limit Kalshi administration sets on the
same account; the exchange accepts any value and always enforces the smaller of the two,
so this value can tighten but never raise the effective limit. As a courtesy, a value
above the current Kalshi-set limit is rejected with a 400 naming that ceiling — a larger
value would never govern. Lowering the limit cancels resting orders until the account is
back within it, exactly like an administrative lowering.
