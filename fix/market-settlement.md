# Market Settlement

> Settlement reports for market outcomes and position resolution

See [Market Settlement](/getting_started/market_settlement) for an overview. Settlement reports are available on **KalshiPT** sessions by default, unless `ReceiveSettlementReports=N` (tag 20127) is set during Logon, and on **KalshiNR** and **KalshiRT** sessions with `ReceiveSettlementReports=Y`.

## Example Settlement Report

```fix theme={null}
// Market settled as "yes", no fees
8=FIXT.1.1|35=UMS|
20105=settle-123|55=HIGHNY-23DEC31|715=20231231|
20107=yes|730=100.00|
20108=1|
  20109=user-456|20110=24|
  704=100|705=0|
  1703=1|
    1704=100.00|1705=PAYOUT|
  136=1|
    137=0.00|138=USD|139=4|891=0|
893=Y|
```

```fix theme={null}
// Direct user: scalar settlement with a sub-centicent rounding fee
8=FIXT.1.1|35=UMS|
20105=settle-456|55=HIGHNY-23DEC31|715=20231231|
20107=scalar|730=30.60|
20108=1|
  20109=user-789|20110=24|
  704=100.01|705=0|
  1703=1|
    1704=30.6030|1705=PAYOUT|
  136=1|
    137=0.00006|138=USD|139=4|891=0|
893=Y|
```

The first example shows:

* Market HIGHNY-23DEC31 settled as "yes"
* User held 100 Yes contracts
* Received \$100.00 payout to balance
* Zero settlement fees

The second example is an independent scalar-settlement scenario for a direct user,
with no collateral netting or settlement advances:

* The user holds 100.01 YES contracts settling at 30.60 cents each.
* Gross payout is `100.01 × $0.3060 = $30.60306`.
* With a starting available balance of $10.0000, settlement brings the balance to
  $40.60306 before rounding. At settlement, this direct-user subaccount's available
  balance is rounded down to $0.0001 precision, giving a $40.6030 ending balance
  and a \$0.00006 settlement fee.
* Net payout (`1704`) is `$30.60306 − $0.00006 = $30.6030`.

The fee reduces the payout, not the settlement price in tag 730. Recover the
pre-fee payout by adding `MiscFeeAmt` to the `PAYOUT` amount; do not deduct the fee
again. Rounding applies to the resulting available balance, not independently
to each payout.

## Pagination

Large settlement batches may span multiple messages:

| Tag | Use Case |
| - | - |
| 20106 | Total number of reports in batch |
| 893 | LastFragment=N for more pages, Y for last |

<Warning>
  **Important:** The `MarketSettlementReportID` (tag 20105) will be different across paginated responses.
  Each page of results generates a new unique settlement ID. Use the `Symbol` (tag 55) ticker to identify fragments belonging to the same paginated settlement.
